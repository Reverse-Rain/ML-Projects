The project involves predicting the risk of a heart attack using machine learning techniques based on a set of medical and demographic variables. Here is a detailed breakdown of the project requirements:

### Project Name: Prediction of Heart Attack

### Objective
To develop a machine learning model that predicts the risk of a heart attack based on patient data. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in evaluating patient risk for timely medical intervention and lifestyle changes.

### Dataset Variables
The dataset includes the following patient information:

- **age**: Age of the patient
- **sex**: Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
- **cp**: Chest pain type
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar (1 = fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, 0 = otherwise)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)
- **target**: Target variable (1 = heart attack risk, 0 = no risk)

### Deliverables

1. **Source Code**: A file containing the complete source code from any IDE, with all the steps involved in the development of the predictive model.
2. **PowerPoint Presentation**: A presentation summarizing the project, methodology, and results.
3. **Video Explanation**: A video explaining the tasks performed and the insights gained during the prediction of heart attack risk.

The provided Excel file likely contains the dataset needed for this project. I can help you with the following steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To understand the dataset and identify any missing values or outliers.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: To prepare the data for model training.
3. **Model Development**: To build and train various machine learning models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: To assess the performance of the models.
5. **Results Interpretation**: To derive insights from the model predictions.
